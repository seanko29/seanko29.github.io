I am currently working as a Research Engineer in [Aim Future AI](https://aimfuture.ai/ko/). Previously, I majored in Applied Artificial Intelligence graduate student @ Sungkyunkwan University, researching in [MAIN Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/skku-milab), advised by [Prof. Jaekwang Kim](https://dramatic-samba-372.notion.site/Jaekwang-KIM-b5955ec7d50f488b8ff7bd29f9148641). I also was a SKT AI Fellowship member (4th generation) with SKT Supernova team in 2022. I received my B.S degree in Molecular Biotechnology @ Ghent University Global Campus and wrote my bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Utku Ozbulak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkuozbulak/) and Prof. Wesley De Neve. My major research interest lies but is not limited to computer vision, generative model, quantization & pruning and LLMs.
